A Minecraft pathfinder bot.


Baritone is the pathfinding system used in [Impact](https://impactclient.net/) since 4.4. There's a [showcase video](https://youtu.be/CZkLXWo4Fg4) made by @Adovin#0730 on Baritone which I recommend. [Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StquF69-_wI) a (very old!) video I made showing off what it can do.

The easiest way to install Baritone is to install [Impact](https://impactclient.net/), which comes with Baritone. The second easiest way (for 1.12.2 only) is to install the v1.2.* forge api jar from [releases](https://github.com/cabaletta/baritone/releases). Otherwise, see [Installation & setup](SETUP.md). Once Baritone is installed, look [here](USAGE.md) for instructions on how to use it.

For 1.15.2, [click here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1qKtCZFURM) and see description.

This project is an updated version of [MineBot](https://github.com/leijurv/MineBot/),
the original version of the bot for Minecraft 1.8.9, rebuilt for 1.12.2 through 1.15.2. Baritone focuses on reliability and particularly performance (it's over [30x faster](https://github.com/cabaletta/baritone/pull/180#issuecomment-423822928) than MineBot at calculating paths).

Have committed at least once a day from Aug 1 2018 to Aug 1 2019.

# Additions in this fork

A new command: chunks
Basically this takes the x and z coordinates for two chunks and autowalks within that area, this is for world downloads. This is different from explore because instead of just walking through loaded chunks to get to the unloaded one, it walks through all unloaded chunks allowing more to be downloaded.

# Getting Started

# API

The API is heavily documented, you can find the Javadocs for the latest release [here](https://baritone.leijurv.com/).
Please note that usage of anything located outside of the ``baritone.api`` package is not supported by the API release
jar.

Below is an example of basic usage for changing some settings, and then pathing to a X/Z goal.

```
BaritoneAPI.getSettings().allowSprint.value = true;
BaritoneAPI.getSettings().primaryTimeoutMS.value = 2000L;

BaritoneAPI.getProvider().getPrimaryBaritone().getCustomGoalProcess().setGoalAndPath(new GoalXZ(10000, 20000));
```

# FAQ

## Can I use Baritone as a library in my custom utility client?

That's what it's for, sure! (As long as usage is in compliance with the LGPL 3.0 License)

## How is it so fast?

Magic. (Hours of [leijurv](https://github.com/leijurv/) enduring excruciating pain)

## Why is it called Baritone?

It's named for FitMC's deep sultry voice.
